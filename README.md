# Conway's Game of Life

Implemented in Go to learn the language.

## Running

Command syntax is quite simple, you need a map and optionally you can control the FPS. The default delay is 500ms resulting in ~2fps (it is not exact because it ignores the time it takes to calculate/render the frame)

`go run . <map_file> [frame_delay_ms]`

As an example (you should be able to copy-paste this)

`go run . ./premade_maps/pulsar.gol`

Or

`go run . ./premade_maps/random_low.gol 50` (~20fps)


As far as "fps" goes nearly anything works, but for me any delay under 15ms(~66fps) causes my terminal to struggle to keep up with the output.

## Building

You could build this if you wanted to for some reason.  
Simply run `go build -o gameoflife(.exe)`.

**linux only!** Another options is to use [alchemist](https://github.com/jasonverbeek/alchemist) to create an AppImage.

`alchemist build`

See `./alchemist.toml` for the scripts that are used for the build.


## Maps

I have made a few maps that can be found in the `premade_maps` folder.

Maps are fairly simple to make, they are a 32x32 grid of cells (I used spaces everywhere but they are optional)

You have 5 options for a cell:

- 0: Empty/Dead cell
- 1: Alive cell
- L: 25% chance of being alive
- M: 50% chance of being alive
- H: 75% chance of being alive

Check `premade_maps/blank.gol` for an easy to start template.

I may add a map editor in the future but that is very unlikely.

## App Icon

For the AppImage and icon has been included which is generated by AI using https://perchance.org/ai-icon-generator
